    <p>Pupin's 1899 patent for loading coils, archaically called "Pupin coils", followed closely on 
        the pioneering work of the English physicist and mathematician Oliver Heaviside, which predates 
        Pupin's patent by some seven years. The importance of the patent was made clear when the American 
        rights to it were acquired by American Telephone & Telegraph (AT&T), making him wealthy. Although 
        AT&T bought Pupin's patent, they made little use of it, as they already had their own development 
        in hand led by George Campbell and had up to this point been challenging Pupin with Campbell's own 
        patent. AT&T were afraid they would lose control of an invention which was immensely valuable due to 
        its ability to greatly extend the range of long distance telephones and especially submarine ones.</p>
